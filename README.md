# Chemical Inventory Management Application
## C964 Capstone
#
### Introduction
This project addresses a real-world challenge faced by Research and Development (R&D) labs in managing chemical inventory. It is purely academic and does not involve proprietary or confidential company information.
Historically, the Company's chemical inventory management relied on manual data entry into shared Excel sheets. This method has proven outdated with the growth, resulting in misplaced or lost chemicals and increased safety risks. To address these issues, this project proposes developing a chemical inventory management system capable of:
- Assigning chemicals to appropriate storage spaces that abide safety regulations.
- managing expiration notifications for chemicals.
- Repeatedly trainable model to scale with the growth of inventory over time.
